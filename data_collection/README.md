# data colelction

- we used AUTSL dataset but later on we are going to collect our own data so we wrote code to make this process easier
- we can collect letters and each letter is required only one time (for text to sign)
- we can collect dataset of videos each sign is saved in a seprate directory with the sign name and each video is around 3 seconds

- we collectd 26 english letters videos for testing
- we colelcted 250 sign videos for testing and they were used in LSTM model
