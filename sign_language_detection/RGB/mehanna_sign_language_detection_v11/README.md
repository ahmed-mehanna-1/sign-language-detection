# Version 11

In this version we tried to train the model on the whole dataset ~28000 video

- As a result of training
    - Each epoch takes around ~4 hours or ~230 minutes
    - After 7 epochs the results was ~1% training accuracy and ~0.80% validation accuracy, so we decided to stop this training process and try to classify less than 226 signs
