this is RGB based method the task is to use the RGB frames for the classification 



### Frame extraction and selection
- [ ]  provide information about how we extraced the frames and how many frames

### pretrained models 
- [ ] write about the first apprach using the VGG and it was overfitting a lot
- [ ] write about resnet and why we are using it rather than any other thing
- [ ] the accuracy without any pretrained models if was there 


# figures of models
- fill the diagram section with diagram of each model describing the architecture


# optimizers and loss function

- [ ] which optimizers and loss function are used and why
- [ ] add label smoothing and that it's better to use it based on the paper


# Models Comparison

| Model | n classes |data source| train_acc | Top 1% | Top 5% | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| VGG + CNN (Fn) | 3 | 3 | n | n2 | n3 | 
| Resnet18 + .. | 3 | 3 | n | n2 | n3 | 
| Resnet18 + .. | 3 | 3 | n | n2 | n3 | 




# how the real time predection work
- [ ] provide info of the techniques used to make the real prediction
