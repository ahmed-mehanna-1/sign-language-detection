# Version 7

In this version we tried to create a new Resnet model with 50 layer

- As a result of this model we got 0.94% training accuracy and 0.54% validation accuracy after 8 epochs
- We used "pytorchvideo" to use its built in models to create our Resnet model

- This model was trained on google colab due to the size of model
