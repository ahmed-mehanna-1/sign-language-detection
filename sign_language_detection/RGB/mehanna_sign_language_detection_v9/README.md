# RGB Version 9

- We found an model architecture in a paper was discussing the problem of Sign Language Recognetion
- That paper was talking about the architecture of the model and all of the hyper-parameters of the model. Also this model was found with a pretrained weights

- As a result of this model, we was not able to calculaate the accuracy, but the loss of the training was ~5.0 so we can guess that the accuracy maybe was around 10% on the training and these numbers was after finishing 20 epochs
