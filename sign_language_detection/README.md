# intro
we found out the the best technique for action recognition is using ensemble between RGB method and pose estimation 
- [ ] write a lot of information about the previous line

# Data 
- [ ] provide information about what data are we using and how did we extraced , where did we downloaded from
- [ ] provide some images from the dataset



# Technologies

- [ ] provide information about pytorch and why we used it 
- [ ] provide information about keras and why we used it 
- [ ] provide information about openCV and why we used it 
- [ ] (numpy,pandas,and other minor libariries) this is optional



# tools we used
- [ ] google colab
- [ ] cloud services in the future if we used them
- [ ] cloud machines if we use any for training


# keras vs pytorch comparison


## big points
- [ ] write important differences between them


- [ ] fill the table the smaller differences

|        | Keras  | Pytorch | 
| ------ | ------ | ------- | 
| 1      | n      | m       | 
| 2      | n      | m       | 
| 3      | n      | m       | 
| 4      | n      | m       | 
| 5      | n      | m       |
