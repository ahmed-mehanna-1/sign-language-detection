# sign language detection model (V1)


this is a basic sign language detection
it only detects two signs so far with accuracy of 100% on training and 100% on validation (it doesn't make scene i know) it also contains the model weights

# progress so far

- [X] video processing and split it to frames 
- [X] Find and download the data and clean it
- [X] find a way to load the data into memory (resizing & reducing batch size & reduce video frames * reduce training data)
- [X] choosing and trying a model and make sure it works

## improvements

- [ ] try to load more data and test the model with 10 signs and trying to get high accuracy 
- [ ] use fit generator to load large amount of data into the Ram at once
- [ ] investigate other models
- [ ] try to test the previous models on real data (video that we captured our self)
- [ ] make uploading 5 signs or 10 an automated process
